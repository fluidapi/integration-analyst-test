# Fluid integration analyst challenge

Developed in pure PHP, including its own simple router manager and api key authorization. Provided as an API endpoint which receives a POST request (multipart/form) and returs JSON data in the body. 

For testing, please refer to the API endpoint documentation importing the *insomnia.json* file into your favorite REST client (Insomnia, Postman...)

Unit test included in the model folder. Should be tested using PHP cli since the router manager will not accept any requests if not for the views.
